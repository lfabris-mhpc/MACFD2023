# Model and Applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics

- Michele Girfoglio (<mgirfogl@sissa.it>)

## Program

The course refers to the use of computational fluid dynamics techniques to address advanced applications in industrial, cardiovascular and environmental contexts. Each topic will be corroborated by a set of numerical examples to be performed within the open source C++ finite volume library OpenFOAM.

## Location

All lectures will be delivered in one of SISSA classrooms and streamed online using the Zoom platform. A link with the lecture will be provided to the students at the end of every lecture.

The following Zoom link will be used for the lectures:
